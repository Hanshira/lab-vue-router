/*
GOAL: train on router & ajax
Use the json-server to generate an API automatically. Take the data from the Cinema billboard exercise
	Routes:
Homepage (/): Landing page
/movies: List movie
/movies/:id See movie info
/movies/new Add movie
/movies/:id/edit: Edit movie
		Iterations:
Make /movies and Homepage with a button to /movies
List all movies (just the titles)
Add a navbar with a link to Homepage at the top of every page
Specific movie pages and add a link to the movie names in /movies
/movies/new route and a button in Homepage to access it
Add a delete button to /movies/:id. Redirect to /movies on success.
/movies/:id/edit. Redirect to /movies/:id.
      BONUSES: Improve user experience by:
Doing form validation
Asking for confirmation on delete
Have a success message on delete AFTER redirection
Add styling & cool animations
	Tell them that they donâ€™t need more components than routes (although they can use more)
	Provide a component with a form to edit/create movies
Optional prop to pass down a default movie
Firing a submit event when clicking on the submit button
	Provide a component to display a movie
Prop to pass down a movie
	Provide a navbar component
Slot to pass down the content of the navbar
	Provide a skeleton for api.js
All the functions defined but without their body
